Peer Feedback

11/1




The peer feedback session provided helpful considerations outlined below:

The ability to zoom along the y axis of a given domain group for the parallel coordinate plots would help emphasize more subtle variation in demographic information such as age and frequency of visit when there are a lot of patients represented.
Having the lines semi transparent in the parallel coordinate plot would be helpful when there is a lot of overlapping lines in the visualization. This could also highlight trends in the density that could potentially be occluded in the overlapping of opaque lines. WIth repeated overlapping, the transparent layering would become darker and more opaque giving more information on the dense overlapping areas.
Having the y-axis scaled to the extent and distribution of the normal population might be something to consider in the visualization moving forward. This would show any higher or lower than normal trends of the patient population as a whole compared to a normal distribution.


The first 2 considerations will be added to the needed functionality and the third will be an option. I am unsure if the third will be a helpful functionality and it should be discussed with the research group.
